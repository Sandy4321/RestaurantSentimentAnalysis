# RestaurantSentimentAnalysis

This project attempts to gain a glimpse of certain region's sentiments of
some fast food restaurants. Sentiments are measured using methods from
the *sentiment* package on a sample of tweets about the restaurants in
questions.

With that said, this small project works with the *twitteR* package as well,
where one can submit queries to the Twitter API through R. To get started, I
suggest navigating to the **RawData** directory and beginning with
the **DataAcquistion** file.
