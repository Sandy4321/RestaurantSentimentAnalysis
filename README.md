# Restaurant Sentiment Analysis

##Project Description

This project attempts to gain a glimpse of certain region's sentiments of
some fast food restaurants. Sentiments are measured using methods from
the *sentiment* package on a sample of tweets about the restaurants in
question.

With that said, this small project works with the *twitteR* package as well,
where one can submit queries to the Twitter API through R. To get started, I
suggest navigating to the **RawData** directory and beginning with
the **DataAcquistion** file. The file will assist with set up. This includes:
loading necessary packages, signing up for a Twitter Dev's account,
authenticating a session with Twitter in R and submitting queries for tweets.
