#A Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Text

##Purpose of the Project
The question we wanted to answer is simple. How do people feel about certain 
fast food establishments? We attempted to answer this question by taking a
look at the tweets that people messaged to certain resturants' Twitter accounts.

Text data has always been a rich source of data, and we feel that analysts
should become familiar with working with it.

In order to answer our question, we had to discover how to measure of people's
sentiments. The team ended up utilizing useful packages in order to perform the
desired analyses.

##Data Extraction
The data came from many sources essentially that was pipelined through the 
**twitteR** package. We collected the tweets that were messaged to a certain
restaurant's Twitter account. 

Here is an example query that we would send in a Twitter session in R:
```
McDsample <- searchTwitter(searchString = "to:McDonalds" , n = 200, lang = "en")
```

However, to interact with Twitter, you'll need to go through the authentication
process. There are directions to do this in the *DataAcquisition.R* file which
can be found in the subdirectory, *DataAcquisition*, of the *RawData* directory.


##A Side Note
If you are interested in Twitter data, but would like to obtain it by other means then we suggest you do it through Python. UC Berkeley's D-Lab possesses a great
walkthrough on how to interact with the Twitter API in Python. However, either
method you choose, you will need to set up a Twitter Developer's account.


##Cleaning the Raw Data
Our data came in the form of character vectors. With that being said, we worked 
closely with the regular expressions in order to clean the tweets. We had to remove
retweet instances, punctuation and other unneeded strings like emojis. We were 
able to take advantage of R's tendency to vectorize data, which makes our cleaning
script very powerful for Twitter text data. 


##Transforming the Data Further
After the cleanup, we possessed vectors of character type data. We needed to 
conduct sentiment analysis to actually answer our question. The package **sentiment** was able to provide us with the methods we needed to get this data.
However, the **sentiment** package is no longer supported on CRAN, so you must 
download the source code. Here are the commands in order to achieve this.

```
